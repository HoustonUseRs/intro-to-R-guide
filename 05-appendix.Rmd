##Installing R on Mac OS X

###Installing R with Homebrew


If you are not sure if you have *Homebrew*, open your Terminal or CLI and type `which brew`. 

If you get output like this: `/usr/local/bin/brew`, then you have *Homebrew* and you are good to go. 

Otherwise, if you get:  `command not found`, you'll need to install it from here: http://brew.sh/.

After confirming you have *Homebrew*, proceed with instructions:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Before installing anything, run `brew update && brew upgrade`
3. Copy/paste the comands below to install R:
```bash
$ brew tap caskroom/cask
$ brew install homebrew/completions/brew-cask-completion
$ brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
$ brew cask install java
$ brew tap homebrew/science
$ brew install R
```

# About this Guide {-}

Houston R Users are hosting a [guided intro workshop](http://www.meetup.com/houstonr/events/234653360/) on November 12, 2016.  This guide is the full version of the short guide handed out at the workshop.  This should be a good reference for reviewing things we covered in person, or for a self-guided introduction to R.

# Welcome to Intro to R

We are very excited you could make it to this Intro to R workshop!  We hope to leave this workshop with some practical practice under our belts working with data in R and the ability to find and understand resources when applying these steps to our own datasets.

## Why R?

R is a programming language designed specifically for statistics.  Because it is a free and open source language, many people have contributed to the R ecosystem.  In addition to being very powerful and expressive for statistical analysis, R has become very popular for doing exploratory data visualization and reporting as well.

## When to use R?

* **R is limited in producing highly-customized and interactive reporting visualizations**<br>
  While R is able to produce interactive graphics, maps, and dashboards, a lot of the more expressive and customized interactive data presentations will require knowledge of JavaScript. The amount you can do directly from within R is increasing rapidly, however, and you can read more about that [here](./05-appendix).

* **R is not as expressive for general tasks such as scraping and crawling**<br>
  New additions to R like `tidyr` and `dplyr` are making R more expressive; the result is R is becoming a strong competitor in more general tasks like [data-mining, data-wrangling, and scraping and crawling](./05-appendix) for data.

* **R requires data to be loaded into memory**<br>
  For projects where exceptionally large data needs to be analyzed or processed very quickly, we will want to consider using [tools that help us work around the memory limitations](./05-appendix).

Overall, R is a top choice for data exploration, modelling, analysis, and static graphics.

## What is the scope of this workshop?

This workshop will cover steps and code that can be readily adapted for small to moderate sized datasets.

Specifically, we will be:

1. Loading in data
1. Exploring it
1. Cleaning it
1. Calculating descriptive statistics
1. Visualizing it
1. Modeling it
1. Making a report

We will also cover how to get help and how to learn more about using R.  Additionally, we've pulled together different resources for things we aren't covering into [our appendix](./05-appendix).

While we will not be able to cover how to handle a wide variety of different datasets and visualizations, our mentors have a wide range of experiences with using R for energy data, bioinformatics, mapping, natural language processing, and much more!  We hope to get to know you throughout the workshop and share domain specific experiences with you.

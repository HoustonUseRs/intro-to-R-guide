# About this Guide {-}

Houston R Users are hosting a [guided intro workshop](http://www.meetup.com/houstonr/events/234653360/) on November 12, 2016.  This guide is the full version of the short guide handed out at the workshop.  This should be a good reference for reviewing things we covered in person, or for a self-guided introduction to R.

# Welcome to Intro to R

We are very excited you could make it to this Intro to R workshop!  We hope to leave this workshop with some practical practice under our belts working with data in R and the ability to find and understand resources when applying these steps to our own datasets.

## Why R?

R is a programming language designed specifically for statistics.  Because it is a free and open source language, many people have contributed to the R ecosystem.  In addition to being very powerful and expressive for statistical analysis, R has become very popular for doing exploratory data visualization and reporting as well.

## Why not R?

While R is able to produce interactive graphics, maps, and dashboards by leveraging JavaScript, a lot of the more expressive and customized interactive data presentation cannot yet be acheived with R.  The gap is closing quickly however, and you can read more about that [here](./05-appendix).

Additionally, while data-mining, scraping and crawling for data can be done in R, those might be tasks better left to Python if you are already familar with Python.  Otherwise, R can handle your data workflow from data gathering to exploration to analysis to presentation.

For projects where the data needs to be analyzed or processed very quickly, we will want to consider using [C within R](./05-appendix).

Overall, R is a great fit for data exploration, modelling, analysis, and static graphics.

## What is the scope of this workshop?

This workshop will cover steps and code that can be readily adapted for small to moderate sized datasets.

## What is missing from this workshop?



## The Plan

Today, we are going to cover:

    1. Loading in the data
    1. Exploring it
    1. Cleaning it
    1. Calculating descriptive statistics
    1. Visualizing it
    1. Modeling it
    1. Making a report

We will also cover how to get help and how to learn more about using R.

While we will not be able to cover how to handle a wide variety of different datasets and visualizations, our mentors have a wide range of experiences with using R for energy data, bioinformatics, mapping, natural language processing, and much more!  We hope to get to know you throughout the workshop and share domain specific experiences with you.

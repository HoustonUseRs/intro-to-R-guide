# Learning More

There are many ways to continue learning R.  No matter what you choose to be your next step, we're here and eager to share experiences and questions!  Join us in person for our [Houston R UseRs Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/houstonr/) or online in our [Slack](https://hrug.slack.com) chat anytime.

## Next Steps

[//]: <> ( If you have a specific project where R is useful, or existing datasets you're wanting to explore, we recommend using R with them, and )

The following resources are great next steps to take for learning more on using R after this workshop.

### R Basics

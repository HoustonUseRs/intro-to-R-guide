# Learning More

There are many ways to continue learning R.  No matter what you choose to be your next step, we're here and eager to share experiences and questions!  Join us in person for our [Houston R UseRs Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/houstonr/) or online in our [Slack](https://hrug-slack.herokuapp.com/) chat anytime.

## How to get help in R

With getting help with a problem or error you are running into with R, or any programming language, it helps others help you when you can produce a [minimal reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).

[//]: <> ( will go through and example of making a minimal reproducible example starting from a problem, talk about stackoverflow, and other ways to get help, how to search for answers, ?help, vignettes, etc. )


## Next Steps

[//]: <> ( If you have a specific project where R is useful, or existing datasets you're wanting to explore, we recommend using R with them, and )

The following resources are great next steps to take for learning more on using R after this workshop.

### R Basics 

To further explore basics of R, following are good resources to begin with  - 

* <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/" target="_blank">  <img src="https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/R_02_2016-05-01.png" style="width:80px"></a>
 A good blog offering tutorials on each R function/package. Since these tutorials are usually generated by other members of the R-bloggers of the community, you get exposure to different R programming conventions and methods of problem-solving. It also operates as a platform for R users to connect.
* <a href="http://swirlstats.com/" target="_blank">  <img src="http://swirlstats.com/images/swirl_new_large_final.png" style="width:80px"></a>
Learn R and data science interactively right in your RStudio console. "Swirl" is a R package that gives you access to a free course repository that includes Beginner friendly courses like 'R Programming', and 'Data Analysis'. After you feel comfortable with the basics, swirl R also has more advanced courses on regression models and how to use packages (such as dplyr) to clean, messy datasets.

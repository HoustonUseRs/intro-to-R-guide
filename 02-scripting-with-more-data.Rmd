# This time it's for real!

Let's pick up the pace and put our newfound skills to the test. For this section, we're gonna use a dataset that looks more like what we'll encounter in real life. It's bigger in both dimensions; it has more rows but also more columns. It also has some missing data (oh noes!). Now things are getting real.

We can load our new dataset the same way as before, using the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
new_data <- read.csv('new_data.csv')
```

I mentioned this dataset has some missing data. It's always a good idea to check, even if you are *sure* your data is complete. We can ask R to tell us whether there are any NAs in the dataset here.

```{r}
is.na(new_data)
```

This will list out `TRUE` or `FALSE` for *every* value in new_data, for the question "is this value equal to NA?". It's kind hard to read, though. If we wanted to get a general sense of how many NAs there were in our entire dataset

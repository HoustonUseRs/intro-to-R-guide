# This time it's for real!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(pacman)
p_load(openxlsx)
```

Let's pick up the pace and put our newfound skills to the test. For this section, we're gonna use a dataset that looks more like what we'll encounter in real life. It's bigger in both dimensions; it has more rows but also more columns. It also has some missing data (oh noes!). Now things are getting real.

## Loading and exploring a larger dataset

We can load our new dataset the same way as before, using the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
airquality <- read.csv('airquality.csv')
```

Let's take a moment to explore the new dataset using tools we learned in the previous section. Try `str`, `head`, `summary` and get a good feel for the dataset. For example, we can find the number of rows using `nrow`.

```{r}
library(magrittr) # load using `library` if not already loaded
airquality %>% nrow()
```

## Counting missing values

I mentioned this dataset has some missing data.  You may have noticed it already when exploring. In R, missing values are represented by the `NA` symbol.

It's always a good idea to check for missing values, even if you are *sure* your data is complete. We can ask R to tell us whether there are any `NA`s in the dataset using the `is.na()` function.

```{r results="hide"}
airquality %>% is.na()
```

This will list out `TRUE` or `FALSE` for *every* value in `new_data`, for the question "is this value equal to `NA`?". It's kind hard to read, though.

If we wanted to get a general sense of how many `NA`s there were in our entire dataset, we could do something like this:

```{r}
airquality %>% is.na() %>% sum()
```

## Ignoring missing values

If we try to call some descriptive statistics on any columns with `NA` values, we will get an ugly result. Let's try getting the mean for Ozone levels.

```{r}
library(dplyr) # load using `library` if not already loaded
airquality %>% summarise(mean(Ozone))
```

Not what we were looking for.

By default, many functions in R will return `NA` if called on a vector with any `NA` values inside. We can override this behavior by adding the `na.rm = TRUE` argument

```{r}
airquality %>% summarise(mean(Ozone, na.rm=TRUE))
```

There are important questions to ask yourself when dealing with missing data; there's no one-size-fits-all answer for it. A slapdash approach is to simply _remove_ any rows with missing data.

```{r}
aircomplete <- airquality %>% filter(complete.cases(airquality))
```
 If you call `nrow` on aircomplete, you'll see we have 111 rows now instead of the 153 we had before.

```{r}
aircomplete %>% nrow()
```

## Non-numeric data

So far, we've primarily worked with numeric data.

Let's talk briefly about how R handles string or character data.

Here's a data frame with some letters.

```{r}
myname <- data.frame(letter=c("k","e","l","s","e","y"))
```

Let's look at the structure of the _myname_ object, and the _letter_ field of the object.

```{r}
myname %>% str()
myname$letter %>% str()
```

Hmm, it says `Factor w/ 5 levels "e","k","l","s",..: 2 1 3 4 1 5`. What does this mean?

By default, R stores string fields in data frames as _factors_.

Behind the scenes, R identifies the unique character strings in the field, substitutes each one with a unique integer, and remembers the original strings as _levels_.

```{r}
myname$letter %>% levels()
myname$letter %>% as.integer()
```

For many processes and analyses, this data structure will work fine.

In some situations, however, it becomes problematic.

Let's try to modify the _myname_ data frame, and make the letters spell out _kelsie_ rather than _kelsey_.

We need to change the letter in the 6th position to `e` and the letter in the 5th position to `i`.

```{r}
myname$letter[6] <- "e"
myname$letter[5] <- "i"
```

Let's print the updated data frame.

Not what we want.

There are a couple of ways to override R's default behavior of storing text fields as columns.

If we're creating a data frame from scratch, we can set the _stringsAsFactors_ parameter equal to _FALSE_.

```{r}
myname <- data.frame(letter=c("k","e","l","s","e","y"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

Check out the structure _str_ and see what is different.

Let's try making the same modifications now.

```{r}
myname$letter[6] <- "e"
myname$letter[5] <- "i"
```

The character data type is much more flexible.

If we've already created (or read) a data frame, we can use the _as.character_ function on the text field itself.

```{r}
myname <- data.frame(letter=c("k","e","l","s","e","y"))
myname %>% str()
myname$letter <- myname$letter %>% as.character()
myname %>% str()
myname$letter[6] <- "e"
myname$letter[5] <- "i"
```

Looking out for factors is critical when typecasting numeric data that is mistakenly stored as text.

Here's another data frame.

```{r}
fives <- data.frame(v1=c("5","10","15","20"))
```

Let's look at the structure and levels:

```{r}
fives %>% str()
fives$v1 %>% levels()
```

We want these data points stored as a numeric type, but currently, they're stored as text, and specifically as a factor.

What does it look like if we convert the factor to numeric?

```{r}
fives$v1 %>% as.numeric()
```

So problematic! Why did this happen?

```{r}
fives$v1 %>% as.character() %>% as.numeric()
```

That works as expected.

Are factors _ever_ useful? Yes.

Here's some pretend survey data.

```{r}
survey <- data.frame(gender=rep(c("Male", "Female"), c(5, 7)), response=rep(c("Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"), 3))
```

Let's change the levels of the gender field.

```{r}
survey$gender %>% levels()
levels(survey$gender) <- c("F","M")
```

What does it look like now?

We can also take advantage of our understanding of the factor data type to convert the response variable into a numeric field.

I want _excellent_ to map to 4, _good_ to map to 3, _fair_ to map to 2 and _poor_ to map to 1.

We'll use the _as.numeric_ function eventually, but first we need to see if the levels are in the order that we want them.

```{r}
survey$response %>% levels()
```

They're not. Let's change them, so that less favorable responses will appear before more favorable responses when alphabetized.

After we change the levels, we'll need to turn the response field into a character field, and then re-factor.

```{r}
levels(survey$response) <- c("D Excellent","B Fair","C Good","A Poor")
survey$response <- survey$response %>% as.character() %>% as.factor()
survey$response %>% levels()
```

Much better. Now we can call the _as.numeric_ function.

```{r}
survey %>% mutate(as.numeric(response))
```

How useful!

### The takeaway

By default, R stores text fields as factors. And factors are strange.

At times it seems like they are working against us.

But if we understand how they work, we can make them work for us!

Now, back to numeric data.

## Analyzing and Visualizing the data using a script

### Creating a R script to save code and analysis

Now, I want you to go back and do _everything_ we just did over again.

What, you think that's ridiculous? The reality is, we often have to go back and make changes upstream. When we do this, it can get very, very painful if we're doing everything interactively, in the _console_.


In all our previous examples we have been using the interactive console.
It is an excellent application to quickly analyze the data, but we need to
keep a reasonable log of what we did (and possibly way).

Let us start by creating a file, with all the `commands` we used in a sequence.

Click the symbol for New Script and you'll see RStudio's built-in text editor pop up.

<img src="assets/create_new_file.png" style="width:400px">

And then we will clear the session, to remove all the variables from the environment. This insures that we are starting with a clean slate.

<img src="assets/clear_session1.png" style="width:400px">

<img src="assets/clear_session2.png" style="width:304px">



Let's take a moment to put all our work in. I know it's a pain but it will pay off if we want to make changes later.

It is good practice, in programming to place all the libraries we need at the top. Imagine arranging all the ingredients before we start following a recipie for our dish.

```{r message=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# read in data
airquality <- read.csv('airquality.csv')
```

We can start by visualizing the data. We have more data to play with now, but let's start with the same plot we used last time.

```{r}
# plot to compare temperature vs ozone
p <- ggplot(airquality) + geom_point(aes(x=Temp, y=Ozone))
print(p)
```

You'll notice two new things about what we did here. First, we assign the output to `p`, this will be important when we want to make adjustments to the plot later. Second, you'll notice when we do that, nothing appears; we have to print the `p` to get it to show up.

Notice how we get warning messages, with NA's, let use
`complete.cases` function, to filter out such rows.


```{r}
# filter for only complete cases
aircomplete <- filter(airquality, complete.cases(airquality))

# create a plot comparing, Ozone levels with Temperature
p <- ggplot(aircomplete) + geom_point(aes(x=Temp, y=Ozone))
print(p)
```


We can run the entire script by clicking *Source* at the top of the editor pane.

To run just a specific line or lines, you can select the section you want to run and then click *Run*.

Let's get back to our data. You may have seen a pattern in the plot we made earlier. Let's pick up our analysis with a little more visualization and some modeling.


## Modeling the data


We'll model the data using the reliable `lm()` function again. Let's add the following to the end of our script and *source* it.

```{r}
ozone_model <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp, data = aircomplete)
print(summary(ozone_model))
```

Our model tells us there is a *statistically significant* relationship between Ozone and Temperature. If we want to add the linear model to our plot, we can use the `geom_abline()` function. `geom_abline()` takes two arguments, the intercept and slope. We can use the `coef()` function to extract those values from the model. Add the following lines to your script and *Source* it.

```{r}
lm_coefs = coef(ozone_model)
print(lm_coefs)
```

With that info, we're ready to add our linear model. Add the following lines to your script and *Source* it.

```{r}
p2 <- p + geom_abline(intercept = -147.64607 , slope = 2.43911)
print(p2)
```

**bonus**

We would go a little further, and bin the temperature
variable into `high` and `low`, to enable comparison with
ozone levels.

```{r}
aircomplete = mutate(aircomplete,
  temp2 = ifelse(Temp > 80, "high", "low"))
```

Next, let us create a box plot using this new `temp2` variable. We would use `geom_boxplot` from ggplot2 to create this plot.

```{r}
ggplot(aircomplete) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=temp2, y=Ozone))
```

We see that low shows up after high on the x axis, and it is counter intuitive. This is because `temp2` is a character,
and ggplot2 sorts this variable alphabetically (**h** of high orders before **l** of low).
So we can use factors, as explained in the previous section to switch their position.

```{r}
aircomplete = mutate(aircomplete,
  temp_fac = factor(temp2, levels = c("low", "high")))
```

We are using `mutate` from `dplyr` to add a new column
`temp_fac`; which is a factor version of `temp2`.
Also, you will notice we have explicitly specified
the levels in a order we would like (`low` and `high`).

Alright! Now lets see how `temp_fac`, comes to use in our boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(aircomplete) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=temp_fac, y=Ozone))
```


## Making a reproducible report

Great. Now, what if we want to make a report of our work? With R, you get the power of `knitr`, which will _knit_ your work together into a report. Let's try it on our current script. Go to File -> Knit Document, name the file `airquality_report` and select HTML, then watch the magic happen!


Here is a link to an example script:

* [example_script.R](https://github.com/HoustonUseRs/intro-to-R-guide/blob/master/example_script.R)
* [example_script.html](example_script.html)

R basically convert the R script into markdown, and then into HTML. So have have the option
of including some additional markdown instructions in this set.
We need just to prefix all lines with a `#'` to use markdown

Here are a set of a few markdown examples.
